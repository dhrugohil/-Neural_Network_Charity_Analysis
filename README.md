Model:
There are total 5 layers and 1 input and 3 Hidden and 1 Output layer. Basically the input layer has 395 neurons i.e lenght of X_SCALED[0], so the 1st hidden Layer has 100, 2nd hidden layer has 30 and 3rd hidden layer has 10.
Yes Target model performance is achieved. Accurracy of the model us 79%. 

Summary:
Overall our model predicts the success of applicants funding with 79% accuracy. We can run the model using more epochs, use Kmeans clustering to see data clusters and use that to define neurons at each level to improve the model further.
